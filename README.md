## FFT & STFT project with python

### Introduction

* It's not a logical code of STFT, it's just a project that I've used STFT with filtering the voice which I want to analysis.

* The code is written in __Python__.

* Presentation materials and codes are in the __project folder__. <br>However, the voice file recorded for the presentation and the voice file used for analysis in the project will not be released.
